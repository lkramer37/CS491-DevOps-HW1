# Homework 1
Data Structures Unit Tests

### Problem 1
In Python, write the implementations for the following data structures: linked list, stack, queue. Each data structure should be contained in its own class and have the complete lineup of operations available. 

### Problem 2
Each class should have as much unit test coverage as possible. 
Whenever applicable, include Function, Statement, Edge, Branch, and Condition coverages. 

Provide an indication in each unit test as to which type of coverage it provides (see python's docstrings conventions: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/ (Links to an external site.)). No UI element is required.
